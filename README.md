### For a little thank you
If you like our work, feel free to buy us a coffee (of which we drink quite a lot :D )  
For now, there is no general link for the team, so each contributer can post his/her preferred donation link here :-)  
But remember, this is absolutely not required. We value any issues and feature requests the same!  
And to all who do donate: Thank you very much :-)
